- Silk screen and GPIO # labels pin- Will the barrel jack height interfere with our ability to plug a micro USB cable into the ESP32?

BEFORE ORDERING 1.1 PCBs
- 3d print of the pcb to test fit.

DONE
- extend pcb past the screw holes a bit, so it's oversized for the case. We'll file it down to fit for the test run.
- bump out the barell connector, half way into the wall of the case.
- formally spec screws for the screw - plastite screws from mcmaster?
--- 5mm long, M1.91 plastite screw, with a Torx T6 head, stainless, 99397A066



LOW PRIORITY
-Radius the corners of the PCB as the corners of the case will have a small radius, and be less poky.


Good
-antenna diving board

AFTER WE GET THE PCBs
- confirm the pin headers fit a standard proto board.
-How does the height stackup work with the sheilds? Super long pins? Receipticals onthe ESP-LED and long pins on the sheild?
-For the main 50pc production run, should we no-populate the pins for the shiled connections? Make those a manual add on for the primary batch?

Ideas:
-Extra space: maybe add extra solder pads for an additional JST connector???
-Extra Space: Add solder pads/vias for 12V in case you want to just solder wires to the 12v line.
